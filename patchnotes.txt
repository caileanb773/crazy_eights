-changed name of method addCard() to addCardToHand() in Player (ambiguity)
-added getter for Player's hand size in Player
-changed method signature for decidePlayDraw in AIPlayer (only need to pass the last played card)
-changed fields of Player from private to protected so they are accessible in AIPlayer
-changed method signature of AIPlayer.decidePlayDraw() to return an int (if they can't draw, and can't play, they must pass)
-added setter for suit in Card class (the suit can change when a player plays an 8). rank is now final
-added handleEmptyDeck() to GameModel. Certain situations could have a player draw off an empty deck, so we call this before to add the played cards back to the deck (besides the top card)
-checkRoundOver() is now isRoundOver(), follows easier to read "isThingTrue" convention
-checkWinCon() is now isGameOver(), method purpose is clearer with this name, and enhances readability

-added a few fields in GameModel (pGameWinner, pRoundWinner, nextTurn, numTwosPlayed)

-added private classes to controller to implement what should happen when buttons are clicked
-added method displayCardsInHand() to the view

-added method updatescoretable to update the score table
-added field to game model that holds AI Player names so that they aren't selected twice

-moved methods for drawing cards, adding cards to hand, playing cards, and determining legal moves from Player class to the Model, where it should have been all along
-added removeCardFromHand() method to Player, instead of fiddling around with getters for the hand
-added boolean isPlayerTurnOver to model. This acts as a flag to tell the model that the current turn is over and the next should be processed. included a getter and setter for this as well
-added boolean isHuman flag to Player class, along with getters and setters. need a way to differentiate between computer controlled players and human players
-renamed getNextTurn() to getNextPlayer() and changed return type from int to Player in Model
