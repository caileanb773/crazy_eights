--- BUGS ---

-if you start a new game in the middle of an ai player's turn, they keep playing
-when the player draws their 12th card, if that card is playable, their turn is still passed

--- CHANGES ---

-probably need to change the way playing twos works to fit prof's rules better.

-when a card is moused over, it would be nice to paint a border around it

-cleanup() at the end of the game needs to:
	-repaint all cards in all zones (lastPlayedCard persists)
	-remove all names from all zones (names persist for some reason; where are they drawn?)
	-set all the text for the scoreboard to be blank/remove the text entirely
	
-if there is a single player game running, block out multipllayer option, and vice versa
