-if you start a new game in the middle of an ai player's turn, they keep playing
-when the player draws their 12th card, if that card is playable, their turn is still passed

--- CHANGES ---

-cleanup() at the end of the game needs to:
	-repaint all cards in all zones (lastPlayedCard persists)
	-remove all names from all zones (names persist for some reason; where are they drawn?)
	-set all the text for the scoreboard to be blank/remove the text entirely
	
-if there is a single player game running, block out multiplayer option, and vice versa

reset turn order
tally scores (model)
refresh scores (host, clients)
display the round winner (host, clients)

if it is

reset pack calls
display game winner (host, clients)
refresh scores (host, clients)
cleanup gamestate (model)
clearview()
cleargame() model

if it's not

handlestartround()




"it is not your turn" could be a more useful message when broadcast to every1

make sure game rounds finish cleanly
make sure game finishes cleanly
handle clients playing an 8

handle disconnects
make sure translations are gucci
would be nice: cannot draw; play a card broadcasts to everyone instead of just 
whoever tried to do the thing
