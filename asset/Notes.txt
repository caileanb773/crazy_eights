----- BUGS -----

-if you start a new game in the middle of an ai player's turn, they keep playing
-when the player draws their 12th card, if that card is playable, their turn is still passed
-clicking cancel on singleplayer name starts game anyway w/ default name
-when a client wins the game (plays their last card) game doesn't detect they've won til the next player finishes their turn (?)

----- CHANGES -----

"it is not your turn" could be a more useful message when broadcast to every1
would be nice: cannot draw; play a card broadcasts to everyone instead of just whoever tried to do the thing
