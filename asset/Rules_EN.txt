Setup:
2-4 players, standard 52-card deck.
Deal 6 cards to each player.
Place the rest as a draw pile, flip one card to start the discard pile.
Gameplay:
Players take turns placing a card that matches the top discard (by suit or rank). Turns go in clockwise order.
Eights are wildâ€”play an 8 to choose a new suit.
If the player has no playable card, draw until you can play. No player can hold more than 12 cards in their hand.
Special Cards:
2: When a 2 is played, the next player in the turn order must pick up 2 cards. This is additive, so if
another 2 is played, then the next player in the turn order picks up 4 cards, and then 6 cards, and then 8.
4: If a 4 is played, the next player must pick up 4 cards. This effect is not cumulative.
If a forced draw (from playing a 2 or a 4) would force a player to pick up cards that would make their
hand size more than 12, the surplus go back to the player who played the "force draw" card (2, 4).
If the player who played the card that initiated the forced draw has cards redirected
to them, but their hand is also full, then they are punished by having the amount
of cards redirected to them turned into penalty points.
Ace: Reverse the turn order.
Queen: Skip the turn of the next player.
Winning:
First player to discard all of their cards wins the round. All remaining players
gain points equal to the number of cards in their hand. When any player reaches
50 points, the game is over, and the player with the least points is the winner.
