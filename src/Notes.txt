-AI could have a difficulty slider; if on easy, the AI will select a card at random
to play. If on hard difficulty, they will always choose a card with a special effect
if they have one. If on easy, and they play an eight, they will choose a random
rank/suit. If on hard, they will choose the optimal suit/rank to choose.
-to keep the window the right size, could add some invisible cards, call pack(), then remove them
