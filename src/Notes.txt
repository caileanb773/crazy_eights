The turn is passed (at least for the player) when their hand size == 12. I drew
a card, my hand size went to 12, and my turn was passed, even though I had a
legal play.
-passing the turn automatically when the player has no moves and a full hand works, though

-need to make sure if the turn comes back around to me and i still have no legal moves, that my turn is skipped

-eight needs to refresh the view when i play it
