The turn is passed (at least for the player) when their hand size == 12. I drew
a card, my hand size went to 12, and my turn was passed, even though I had a
legal play.

-when having cards redirected into your hand, actionlisteners are not added to them
-penalty points dont cause the scoreboard to be updated
